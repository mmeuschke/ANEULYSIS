Aneulysis is a software to visualize simulated aneurysm data comprising time-dependent scalar, vector and tensor fields. 

Aneulysis consists of five modules the visually explore the different data types describing the aneurysm wall behaviour and internal blood flow. 

We publish here the source code of the five modules as well as an exemplary data set to test the modules.
